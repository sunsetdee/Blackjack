# Blackjack

## Blackjack AKA 21 is a widely popular card game available in almost all major casino. It is a comparing card game between one or more players vs. the dealer. Each player start with two card and take turns to competes against the dealer. Its objective is to reach 21 or whoever's closer to 21 where A's can be one or 11. If the player is busted(AKA over 21), the player loses, if the dealer is over 21, the dealer loses. Otherwise the player and dealer compete to see who's closer to 21.

## The technologies I've used for this game is 
1. HTML, that renders the text you see on screen and it's formats and orders. 
2. Second I've used CSS which is the styling you see on screen, this beautiful deck of card and any colors you see are rendered by CSS .
3. Third I used CSS Cardstarter Library to render this deck of card. 
4. Lastly I've used Javascript that handles the logic of this game as well as the buttons that are clicked on.

## For future enhancements
1. I planned to add one or more players to the game vs. the dealer instead of just one vs one.
2. I would also like to add the option for a player to split the card. 
3. Lastly one day I want to deploy this game online to support online multi player.
